# Task3_todoApp

I developed a To-Do List Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Add, edit, and delete tasks easily.

Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.

Persistent data storage using localStorage, so tasks remain saved even after refreshing the page.
